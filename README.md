# Code challenges

## Installation

Node version - see `.nvmrc` file.

Run below to install dependencies:

```
npm ci
```

## Part One - Problem solving

Work through the tests found in `./tests` and make them pass.
More info about the each challenge can be found in the `*.js` files.

_We might only go through a few of these, so once the watcher is running you can use `c` to run tests only on the changed files. You can also use the pattern glob to isolate specific tests too._

Run the below command to run tests and watcher:

```
npm run first
```

## Part Two - Component challenge

Read the instructions in `./src/AutoComplete/AutoComplete.js` file. Extra context and steps are provided to help you complete this challenge.

Run below command to start the storybook server:

```
npm run second
```
